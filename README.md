# CT3505-24 - Traffic Flows and Management (TFM): 2025/26 Assignments 1&2

## Introduction

This repository contains everything required to complete the integration project for course CT3505-24.
Please refer to course materials (Brightspace) to align with your duties.

Assignment 1 builds on [the mercury project](https://runmercury.com). The typical python notebook is turned therefore in a simple, easy-to-use Graphical User Interface.

Assignment 2 is instead a standard Jupyter notebook. This can be used with your browser, however it is recommended to follow the instrucitons contained in [the install guide](INSTALL.md), and adopt Visual Studio Code, particularly for beginners, given the user-friendly nature of the Integrated Development Environment.

## Getting support

A lab session is foreseen in week 1.5. During this session, we will support you in installing and configuring everything on your computer, so that you can get started with these assignments. You can of course always reach out to the course coordinato & TAs in case of issues.
