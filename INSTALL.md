# CT3505-24 - Assignments 1 & 2 codebase installation instructions

## Installation steps (MacOS, Linux)
Note: these installation steps will be largely based on Visual Studio Code as your main interface. Other IDEs can be used, but the creation / activation of appropriate conda environments will have to be handled manually.

- Download and install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- Download and install [miniconda](https://www.anaconda.com/docs/getting-started/miniconda/main) (recommended) or your preferred version of anaconda, to allow creating project-based environments
- Download and install [SUMO](https://eclipse.dev/sumo/)
- Launch Visual Studio Code
- In Visual Studio Code, select File -> Open folder.. and navigate to the folder containing this file.
- Open (any) one of the project's Jupyter notebooks (e.g. 'Assignment 1.ipynb')
- Click on "Select kernel..." on the top right of the Jupyter notebook screen, select "Python Environments..." and "Create new python environment". Create a ".conda" environment. Each time you open VSCode and this project, it will remember this is the right environment and always use it.
- Open VSCode's terminal (menu bar -> Terminal) *after* creating and selecting your .conda enviroment.
- Activate your new enviromnent by typing the following in the terminal window: conda activate .conda/
- Install *lxml* by typing the following in the terminal window: ```pip install lxml```
- Install *tud-sumo* by typing the following in the terminal window: ```pip install tud-sumo```
- Install *mercury* by typing the following in the terminal window: ```pip install mercury```

## Installation steps (Windows)
1. Download and install [Anaconda desktop](https://www.anaconda.com/download)
2. Download and install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
3. Download and install [SUMO](https://eclipse.dev/sumo/)
4. Download the project [repository](https://github.com/DAIMoNDLab/CT3505-24/archive/refs/heads/main.zip), unzip it and place the folder in a recognizeable place (e.g. in your Documents folder)
5. Launch Anaconda navigator
6. Create a new anaconda environment, select python 3.12, give the environment a recognizeable name (e.g. ct3505)
7. Launch Visual Studio Code *from within Anaconda*
8. in VSCode, do File -> Open Folder... and select the folder where you unzipped the project repository
9. in VSCode, click on Assignment_1.ipynb
10. in VSCode, Open a new terminal (... -> Terminal -> New Terminal)
11. (only once!) In the terminal, type the following:
- pip install lxml
- pip install tud-sumo
- pip install mercury

## Launching steps (Windows)
1. Be sure to follow the install steps, first
2. Follow steps 7-10 from the install guide to launch VSCode and the appropriate terminal environment
3. Type 'mercury run' in the terminal window
You can now work on Assignment 1

## Additional settings for Assignment 2 (Windows only, *only once*!)
1. In VSCode, click on the Extensions tab, navigate to the Jupyter extension
2. Click on "Install specific version..." and select version 2025.7.0 from the list
